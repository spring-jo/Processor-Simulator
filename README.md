# Processor-Simulator
Using Java, the project simulate how the tasks enter the memory and how the memory deals pending them then doing an arbitrary process over them.

The program takes a file of processes, as in the suggested data (data and data1) the file starts with two numbers first number refers to the number of processors you want, the second number refers to the number of processes you want to process, then number of lines equal to number of processes follow.

Each line represent a process, the process details as follows, initialization time required time and the priority of the task respectivly, the processes must be ordered for the code to work.
